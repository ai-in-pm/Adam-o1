Adam-o1 is the world's first **"Agenteer"**, an AI agent designed to autonomously build, refine, and optimize other AI agents. 

It serves both as a practical tool for developers and as an educational framework demonstrating the evolution of agentic systems.
Adam-o1 will be developed in iterations, starting with just a simple Pydantic AI agent that can build other Pydantic AI agents,
all the way to a full agentic workflow using LangGraph that can build other AI agents with any framework.
Through its iterative development, Adam-o1 showcases the power of planning, feedback loops, and domain-specific knowledge in creating robust AI agents.
